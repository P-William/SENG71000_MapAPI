# SENG71000_MapAPI


While working on our project for SENG710000 we needed to use a map API.
However, we were unable to find a good free API that met our needs.


So for the purposes of the project we will be simulating the API.

Our map API works in the following way:
1. Endpoints for retrieving different map data 
2. Data returned is randomly generated by the API 
3. All data generated by the API is cached in the database.

For example, I want the address of a certain set of coordinates and will use the endpoint for such.
The API will generate a random address for those coordinates and save it within the database.
If someone again requests the address for the same coordinates they will be given the same address.
